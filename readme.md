### Development points 
* [Very useful read](https://marcandrew.me/ui-ux-tips-collection-vol-one/). Points taken are 
  * **Try to create generous Tappable areas on Mobile** : Changed header link to icons
  * **Using just one typeface in your design is all good. Ignore the haters** :     
* [SVG Header image](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/11/styling-and-animating-svgs-with-css/)
  * Initially tried with `<img>` and tried to change color with `fill` it did not work and after reading above article got to know i) with `img` `CSS background image` you cannot do any CSS interactions which includes changing fill. So had to use `svg` in the pug itself and now everything works. My initial intention was to keep the SVG separate not put it in pug but due to limitations had no choice.
